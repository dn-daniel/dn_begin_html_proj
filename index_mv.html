<h1>The Best (Anime) Movies According to Denny</h1>

<h2>My top 3 Anime movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
<p>
  Favorite Miyazaki film by far, excellent characters, compelling plot, themes of nature vs industrialization and humanity, conflict and resolution, and an excellent sweeping soundtrack
</p>
<h3>Ghost in the Shell (or GitS 2: Innocence)</h3>
<p>Classic Cyberpunk Anime Film that started a franchise. Techno setting, philosophical questions on our human nature, and action scenes, plus the traditional Japanese inspired Soundtrack</p>
<h3>Summer Wars</h3>
<p>
  Great summer film (pun intended), great cast, and themes of family,
  gaming, digital life, escalating plot, action scenes, hype moments, etc.
